# ISE-5984---Statistical-Learning-and-Data-Science--HW-1
Using the R programming language, supervised machine learning algorithms and various data analysis techniques are implemented to analyze home equity loan, zipcode, and prostate cancer data.

Questions:

1. Use R to reproduce the Home Equity Loan exercise in the first unit of notes, “Introduction to Data Mining”. The data file, “hmeq.csv”, is given on our course website.

2. (Ex 2.8 in the book of ESL by HTF)
Compare the classification performance of linear regression and k-nearest neighbor classification on the zipcode data. In particular, consider only the 2’s and 3’s, and k = 1, 3, 7, and 15. Show both the training and test error for each choice. The zipcode data are available from the book website: http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/

3. Use R to reproduce the results of Best Subset and Ridge Regression method applying to the Prostate Cancer example.
